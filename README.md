# LoAF - Finder
## Description
This script helps you analyze Long Animation Frame (LoAF) entries to identify performance bottlenecks in your web application.
It filters and cross entries returning from both "long-animation-frame" and "longtask" PerformanceObserver based on keywords you provide. 
The data is also categorizes into groups for comparison and is available for download as a CSV file.

#### Google's Long Animation Frame (LoAF) API: 
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/long-animation-frames
https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames

## Features:
- Filters LoAF entries based on script names, URLs, or function names.
- Groups entries into two groups (A & B) for easy comparison.
- Provides detailed summaries of relevant LoAF entries, including blocking duration, execution time, and script details.
- Generates downloadable CSV reports for further analysis.

## Instructions:
This script helps you finds relevant long animation frame entries by looking for keywords you specify in the scripts data returning from the loAF API.

### Edit the settings:
1. Set `promptDownloadsMessage` to `false` to disable controlling the downloads using prompts.
2. Enter keywords to the `groupASearchList` and `groupBSearchList` arrays.
   * **Important Note - Leaving groupA empty will include all entries into group A without filtering.**
   * **You can still use groupBSearchList to filter entries into group B.**
3. Set `shouldDownloadMainReport` to true to download the main report.
4. Set `shouldDownloadAllOtherReports` to true to download all other reports.
5. Adjust the `keysToIgnoreInReports` array to exclude specific fields from reports.
6. Set `inTesting` to true when running project's unit tests.

### Run the script:
Run the script in your devTools console or as a snippet in the source tab.

### View the results:
The script will console the results in the devTools console.

### Download reports: (Optional)
You'll be prompted to download reports containing detailed data for each group.
* You can choose to disable this prompt by setting `promptDownloadsMessage` to `false`.
* You can also control what reports to downloads by setting the `shouldDownloadMainReport` and `shouldDownloadAllOtherReports` settings.
* you can also download the reports later by running the `downloadReports` function in the console.
* 

### Example Usage:
1. Update `groupASearchList` and `groupBSearchList` arrays with keywords.
2. Run the script in your browser's developer tools console or as a snippet.
3. Choose if to download reports.
4. Open devTools console to view the results.

#### Note:
This script relies on the browser's PerformanceObserver API for long-animation-frame and will not work in all environments.
