# LoAF - Finder
## Description
This script helps you analyze Long Animation Frame (LoAF) entries to identify performance bottlenecks in your web application.
It filters "long-animation-frame" Performance entries based on keywords that you provide, and finds the correlated "long-task" entries.
The data is also categorized into groups for comparison and is available for download as a CSV file.

  isInNumberOfLoafs | The number of LoAFs the script is part of
  isInNumberOfLongTasks | The number of long tasks the script is part of
  loafsIds | A list of the loafs the script is part of
- All-LoAFs-Entries-Scripts - contains all of the scripts with the data supplied by the API
  

## Instructions:
Follow these steps to find relevant "long-animation-frame" Performance entries that contain scripts that match the supplied keywords.

### Edit the settings:
1. Set `promptDownloadsMessage` to `false` to disable controlling the downloads using prompts.
2. Enter keywords to the `groupASearchList` and `groupBSearchList` arrays.
   * **Important Note - Leaving groupA empty will include all entries into group A without filtering.**
   * **You can still use groupBSearchList to filter entries into group B.**
3. Set `shouldDownloadMainReport` to true to download the main report.
4. Set `shouldDownloadAllOtherReports` to true to download all other reports.
5. Adjust the `keysToIgnoreInReports` array to exclude specific fields from reports.
6. Set `inTesting` to true when running project's unit tests.

### Run the script:
1. Copy the contents of 'src/loaf-finder.js'
2. Open in Chrome the page that you want to check
3. Execute the code

More information or devTools snippets can be found here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets

### View the results:
The script will print the results in the devTools console.

### Download reports: (Optional)
You'll be prompted to download reports containing detailed data for each group.
* You can choose to disable this prompt by setting `promptDownloadsMessage` to `false`.
* You can also control what reports to download by setting the `shouldDownloadMainReport` and `shouldDownloadAllOtherReports` settings.
* you can also download the reports later by running the `downloadReports` function in the console.
